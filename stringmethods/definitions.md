## Some Built in JavaScript Methods to Do Things with Strings

- String.length: length of the string!
- String.charCodeAt(0): delivers the unicode value for the letter at (0), in this case
- String.toUppercase: Makes things uppercase
- String.toLowercase: Makes things lowercase
- String.concat('joe', 'bob'): joebob - concats two things together
- String.includes('arg'): Does this string contain a thing you're searching for? (Ex: BobForPresident.includes('President') = true)
- Number.toString(): Forces the number to become a string instead (you can also do "String.toString()" if you really want)
